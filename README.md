# Analyzing-Marketing-Campaigns-with-Pandas_Case-study

This case-study built on Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.
Translated business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?" "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business.
